This is an experimental backend.

```
    $ yarn # to install dependencies
    $ yarn test
```

# To run the test suite:
The `$CHROME_BIN` environment variable must be set to the location of a custom Chromium build. 

e.g. in `~/.bash_profile`:

`export CHROME_BIN=$HOME/Documents/PROJECTS/tfjs-core-wrapper/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`
