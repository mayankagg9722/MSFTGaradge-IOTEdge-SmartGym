## Description
By coming in contact with the gym equipment, the weight, seat and various other settings are auto adjusted as per the user's body and training plan.
The equipment will also measure the work out details like reps, sets, weights and store in the cloud.
By analysing the pattern, the app will also provide personlised training plan.
On equipping the gym with cameras, user will also get recommendations to improve posture and prevent injuries
As part of the hackathon, based on the skill sets of the team members, idea is to get at least 2 of the above to a POC stage.

## INSPIRATION
That which is not measured is not improved. Although there are many apps to record and analyse gym workouts, they need user input. By connecting the equipments at the gym, we can democratise having a personal trainer.
